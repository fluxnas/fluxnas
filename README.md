> Yoga teacher, boxer and web developer in progress, that's a little bit of me !    
   
## Three most surprising skills :
 - **devoured reality :** I am eager to learn, to discover and to experience new things: from a parachute jump to diving in the depths of the matrix
 - **bounce back :** whatever the situation, whether good or bad, there is a lesson to be learned and a potential for evolution
 - **making the scorpion yoga posture !**
 
 ## Things I love the most about this world :
- pay attention to details, spend time making things look good :
create environments where people feel fine to allow the potential of everyone grow. it is vital for me to feel good where I am !
- to be in movement physically and mentally by practicing yoga or boxe and also by feeling evolved and crossed by encounters that make me move !
- my peugeot 205 ! It's a real true love story between us, we travel the world together !

## The goals you want to achieve as a developer during the Becode :
- eat code
- talk code
- and dream code

## The fears :
I am afraid of the frame and the flatness of things in my life and in the world. I am also afraid of formatting ideas, of being caught up in a flow that leaves no place for critical thinking and questioning. And sometimes, I am afraid that these ideas exclude me.

## Look forward to :
Even if I have many dreams and aspirations, I want to stop living in projection of Me. So, to be appeased, laided down and satisfied with myself : try to be in the present would be already great ! So, in the moment learning code is my goal.


## What you like most about working in a team :
- discover each other's qualities, new ways of thinking and approaching situations, it's always inspiring.
- see the potentialities of each one, look at the way they fit together and observe that each one has its place. The group is a micropart of society so, that's interesting to observe it.
- working hard but with fun !
