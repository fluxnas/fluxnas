# Hanna Autajon Connier

> _After a past in the artistic field, I took a decisive turn during lockdown and started to train myself as an autodidact. I continued this reconversion in the web development and I decided to professionalize this project. At the moment, I'm following an intensive 7 months training in web development at BeCode where I'm laying solid foundations for the future._   
> **I'm looking for an internship starting from april 2023.**   
> _I like to challenge myself through reativity, ingenuity and finding solutions whatever the situation._   
   
## Three most surprising skills :
 - **devoured reality :** I am eager to learn, to discover and to experience new things: from a parachute jump to diving in the depths of the matrix
 - **bounce back :** whatever the situation, good or bad, there is a lesson and potential for evolution
 - **making the scorpion yoga posture !**
 
 ## Things I love the most about this world :
- **pay attention to details**, spend time making things look good : create environments where people feel fine to allow the potential of everyone grow. it is vital for me to feel good where I am !
- **be in movement physically and mentally** by practicing yoga or boxe and also by feeling evolved and crossed by encounters that make me move !
- **my peugeot 205** ! It's a real true love story between us, we travel the world together !

## What you like most about working in a team :
- discover each other's qualities, new ways of thinking and approaching situations, it's always inspiring.
- see the potentialities of each one, look at the way they fit together and observe that each one has its place. The group is a micropart of society so, that's interesting to observe it.
- working hard but with fun !
