_After a past in the artistic field, I took a decisive turn during lockdown and started to train myself as an autodidact. I continued this reconversion in the web development and I decided to professionalize this project. **At the moment, I'm following an intensive 7 months training in web development at BeCode** where I'm laying solid foundations for the future._   

> _I like to challenge myself through creativity,    
> ingenuity    
> and finding solutions whatever the situation.
> whatever the situation, good or bad, there is a lesson and potential for evolution !_   
    
 ## 💛 Things I love the most about this world 💛
- **pay attention to details**, spend time making things look good : create environments where people feel fine to allow the potential of everyone grow. it is vital for me to feel good where I am !
- **be in movement physically and mentally** by practicing yoga or boxe and also by feeling evolved and crossed by encounters that make me move !
- **my peugeot 205** ! It's a real true love story between us, we travel the world together !
   
## 👩‍💻 What you like most about working in a team 👩‍💻
- discover each other's qualities, new ways of thinking and approaching situations, it's always inspiring.
- see the potentialities of each one, look at the way they fit together and observe that each one has its place. The group is a micropart of society so, that's interesting to observe it.
- working hard but with fun !
