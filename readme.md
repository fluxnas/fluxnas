_After a past in the artistic field, I took a decisive turn during lockdown and started to train myself as an autodidact. I continued this reconversion in the web development and I decided to professionalize this project. **At the moment, I'm following an intensive 7 months training in web development at BeCode** where I'm laying solid foundations for the future._   

> _I like to challenge myself through creativity,    
> ingenuity    
> and finding solutions whatever the situation  
> whatever the situation there is a lesson and potential for evolution !_
